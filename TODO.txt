== Design ==

- user account page
- organize dashboard css
- figure out how to center input with padding without applying box-sizing
- style inputs with focus styles
- change all static url references with the {% STATIC_URL %} tag


=== UI ideas ==

- make the forgot password link very faded and subtle, but slowly more prominent as the user spends more time on the login form
- check if name looks valid (4+ consonants in a row, high proportion of asdf, non-character)
